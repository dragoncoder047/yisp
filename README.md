# Yisp

**This project is abandoned.** The code in the `oldsrc/` directory is my first attempt, the `src/` is my second, and neither are functional. Copy/paste at your own risk.

This repository is the rather incomplete beginnings of a Lisp-ish language implemented as an Arduino library.

Yisp was inspired by (and most code borrowed from) [@technoblogy/ulisp-esp](https://github.com/technoblogy/ulisp-esp).
